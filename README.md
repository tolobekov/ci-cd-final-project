# Final project scenario
Youâ€™re part of a team responsible for building an innovative microservice, a RESTful API that allows users to manage and track counters. Another team has already developed the user interface (UI) for this microservice, and it's now your turn to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the backend services.

Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions
Your first task is to set up CI pipelines using GitHub Actions. The codebase comes with unit tests for the provided endpoints. Your goal is to automate the linting and testing processes. You will create a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

Continuous Deployment (CD) with OpenShift Pipelines
In the second phase, establish CD pipelines within OpenShift Pipelines. These pipelines should include linting, testing, building an image, and the seamlessly deploying the microservice to an OpenShift cluster.

You need to provide the URL for your repository with the GitHub workflow and tekton yaml files in addition to other screenshots as evidence of your work. Your evidence will be essential for peer project evaluation. Best of luck with your project!
